Discontinuous Galerkin Method
This repository provides an implementation of the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for solving differential equations with high-order accuracy and flexibility. The DG method is suitable for problems with complex geometries and those requiring local refinement.

Features
High-order accuracy for solving differential equations

Flexible handling of complex geometries

Efficient parallelization
