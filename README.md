Discontinuous Galerkin Method
--------------------
This repository provides an implementation of the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for solving differential equations with high-order accuracy and flexibility. The DG method is suitable for problems with complex geometries and those requiring local refinement.

Features
--------------------
High-order accuracy for solving differential equations

Flexible handling of complex geometries


Installation & Usage
--------------------
1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MohammadNawawra2003/Discontinuous-Galerkin-Method-.git

2.Navigate to the project directory and follow the setup instructions provided in the docs/ directory.
