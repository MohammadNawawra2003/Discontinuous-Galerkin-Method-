# Discontinuous-Galerkin-Method-
This repository contains Python code implementing core components for a Space-Time Discontinuous Galerkin (STDG) solver aimed at solving the 1D linear advection equation (`u_t + a u_x = 0`). The method discretizes the problem directly on a 2D space-time domain using triangular elements.
